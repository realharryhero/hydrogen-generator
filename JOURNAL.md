I don't have anything to show yet, sadly. I suppose though that I'll explain what it is why (on earth) I chose to create this.

This is based on [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIWgzVaGn4Y) by Hyperspace Pirate; you can watch it to get a feel for what I'm doing, So this will literally be 
a machine that generates hydrogen and stores it somewhere (**without using a steel tank, because it will go through steel - use aluminum tanks**) using water hydrolysis. The concept is simple - run a voltage through water (H20)
with something like this setup:

This hydrogen is then stored in a little dome with this schematic below (from Hyperspace Pirate's video):

Then it's vaccum pumped into a tank or whatever. So this is pretty nice! A few issues that I'll need to address:

1. Hydrogen and oxygen can go boom. yeah. We'll attempt to store very little hydrogen / oxygen and do this outside / in somewhere nonflammable.
2. Hydrogen can actually tunnel through steel tanks because _yes._ (something something chemistry.) We'll have to use aluminum tanks, which are also safe and can hold up to [3000 psi](https://www.hkarmy.com/products/48ci-3000psi-aluminum-compressed-air-tank#:~:text=The%20aluminum%20tanks%20come%20with,48ci%20%2F%203000psi) (we'll probably store 125 psi or so). 
3. Using stainless steel electrodes to run voltage through will make chromium salts (because stainless steel contains chromium), which may turn into hexavalent chromium and cause me cancer. I'll use a [99.995% Amazon's Choice pure zinc anode strip](https://www.amazon.com/99-995-Electroplating-Electrode-0-04x1x6-1mmx25mmx150mm/dp/B08NG7LL36/ref=pd_ci_mcx_di_int_sccai_cn_d_sccl_2_1/135-8603975-6186000?pd_rd_w=2jsIB&content-id=amzn1.sym.751acc83-5c05-42d0-a15e-303622651e1e&pf_rd_p=751acc83-5c05-42d0-a15e-303622651e1e&pf_rd_r=ZG0VWECX1ZP9JQ52JKSD&pd_rd_wg=7LSlm&pd_rd_r=17e42c81-a2d8-41cc-9823-036c121e3d18&pd_rd_i=B08NG7LL36&psc=1) to avoid this issue.

So why do this? I want to build rockets / do nuclear/chemical engineering / be an alchemist, so this seems like a good first step. I've done a lot of physics olympiad studying, so I know some parts of electricity and magnetism and whatnot
that will hopefully let me not die.
